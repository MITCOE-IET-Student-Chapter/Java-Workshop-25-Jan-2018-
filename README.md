# Running your Java program

1. To run your Java program, make sure that the parent class has the same name as that of the file. e.g. If `Class Hello` is your parent class, make sure you name your file `Hello.java`
2. Compile the `.java` file by firing command, `javac Hello.java`, this will output you a   `.class` file of the same name, i.e., for our case, Java-Compiler will generate `Hello.class`
3. To run the code, fire the command, `java Hello`. Remember to exclude `.class` extention.
