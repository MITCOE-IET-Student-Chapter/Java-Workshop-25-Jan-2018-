# Inheritance in Java

Inheritance is the process of a sub class deriving properties and behavior i.e. data members and member functions, from a super class.

## Overiding

1. Function overiding is when a sub class, changes the body of a method inherited from its super class.
2. To overide a function, the return type and the parameters passed must be the same.

## Overloading

Function overloading is when the functions of the same class, use the same method name, but defer in the following:
1. **Return Type**
2. **Number of Parameters**
3. **Type of Parameters**
4. **Order of Parameters**
